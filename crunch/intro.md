# Crunch

## Notes

* Less static, more like a tree
* Strike vs. Pierce?
* Ding, swish, ack, gah
* Imperials know pierce, vestiges know strike (through necessity)
* Powers will need to be balanced for PvP. Only the most powerful abilities can take someone out with one hit.
* Porting abilities from Crucible seems reasonable. Social Network, Informant Network, Confidant, etc. are awesome.


## Martial

* Strike: Does extra damage
* Pierce: Bypasses armour (shouldn't go past vitality, however)
* Backstab: Extra damage on unaware target
* Stun: Stuns the target
* Cripple: Cripples the struck limb (temporarily?)
* Sunder: Breaks the struck item (temporarily?)
* Knockback: Knocks the target back a reasonable distance


## Social

* Social Network: Hand in information for scrip, get bits of information.
* Informant Network: Get better and more targeted information.
* Confidant: Protect information from getting on to the social/informant network.
* Focus manipulation
* Vitality manipulation (morale)


## Low Magic

* Ward vs. specific things


## Alchemy

* Transmute: Re-arranges matter as needed to match the provided schematic. Allows on-the-fly equipment creation
* Repair Item: Fixes all physical and alchemical damage to an item, and restores it to working condition. Item focus (if any) reset to zero.


## Rune Magic

* Rune Shield: Adds armour to the target
* Force bolt: Deals a point of damage to the struck target
* Visibility sphere: Makes invisible things visible
* Phase shift: Remove oneself from reality


## Death Magic

* Soul Strike: Deal additional damage on successful strike
* Horcrux: Trap soul energy for later use
