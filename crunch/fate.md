# FATE

Key points:

* Use Unwritten as a base for stress, challenges, etc.
* Adapt magic system from Dresden files.
* Alter FATE aspect mechanics to fit with Masque foci.

Characters have three Foci:

1. High Concept (HC) - Must include Imperial/Vestige and Ministry/House.
2. Fatal Flaw (FF)
3. Personality trait

Unlike Aspects, Foci can only be used to activate Stunts.

Add advantage/disadvantage mechanic by adding an extra die and taking the 4 best/worst.

Skills are done by pyramid, with all of them being allocated from +4 to -2.
Stunts represent the abilities given to the character via Resources/Renown (aka xp).
