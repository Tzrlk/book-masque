# Foci

Every character in the story of Masque has a certain number of Foci that they draw their power from. These foci...

If at any point the player cannot remember what state a focus is in, it immediately discharges.

## Power Foci
These foci provide a source of energy to the character. Whenever they would use an ability that has a focus cost, the character must discharge a number of their charged power foci to satisfy that cost. Following this process frees those foci for charging again.

## Malign Foci
The antithesis of power foci, these foci prevent any and all power foci a character posesses from being discharged while any malign foci are discharged. Each malign focus a character possesses is tied to a situational trigger that will cause it to discharge immediately.

## Examples

### \#1 Charging
Conflict Minister Ramal is in a bar, having a disagreement with one of the other patrons. He has the "argumentative" power focus, and decides to play devil's advocate to charge it up, having forgotten whether he charged it earlier. He can now use one of his abilities, but his conversation partner is none too pleased.

### \#2 Discharging
His conversation tactic get heated, and Ramal finds himself in a brawl. He wants to end things quickly, so he uses his "sucker-punch" ability to knock-out his opponent before the fight spreads. Since he just charged it up, Ramal figures it's fair that his "argumentative" focus should pay for itself, and discharges it to pay for the ability usage.

### \#3 Malignancy
Ramal was beaten-up a lot by bullies as a child, and after a rather nasty and recent toturing has developed "brawl-induced kleptomania" as a malign focus. Since he was just in a brawl, his focus discharges, and he now needs to steal something before he can power any more of his abilities.
