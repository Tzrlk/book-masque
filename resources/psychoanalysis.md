//TODO: Seems like there needs to be an ability to force a person to discharge a focus of their choice during conversation. Something to make the process of Discovery/Revelation a bit easier.

## Honesty/Truth
This ability allows the minister/priest the ability to force a truthful answer to a question out of someone. The question can have any amount of context beforehand (a whole discussion in most cases), but when the ability is used, the next question must be answered truthfully by the target. This does not, however, compel the target to answer the question, or tell the whole truth.

## Discovery/Revelation
A minister/priest with this ability is able to discern from conversation what foci another character has. Activating this ability requires locking a focus until the target attempts to recharge one of theirs. Once the target has done so, the minister/priest's locked focus discharges, and they learn what focus the target just recharged. If the target leaves the minister/priest's observation, the effect ends, and the locked focus discharges.
_Prerequisite: Honesty/Truth_

## Confrontation/Forbidding
With knowledge of another person's foci and this ability, a minister/priest can, when they next observe their target recharging a focus, prevent the target's focus from recharging. This must be confrontational, with a clear explanation of what the target is doing, and a reason why they should not benefit from it.
_Prerequisite: Discovery/Revelation_

## Adjustment/Transformation
Using this ability allows a minister/priest to grant a temporary focus to eventually replace one a target has. The target must willingly discharge the focus that is to be replaced, then the minister/priest provides them with an additional focus to use instead. Each time the temporary focus is discharged, it must be re-added by the minister/priest for it to be useable again. If at any point the target charges the focus they're attempting to replace, the focus they're replacing it with disappears, and the process must start from scratch. If the target can continue using the substitute without resorting to the original for at least 24h, they no longer need the minister/priest to re-add the temporary focus between discharges. If they can continue to not use the original for another 24h, they lose the original, and the temporary one becomes permanent.
_Prerequisite: Confrontation/Forbidding_
