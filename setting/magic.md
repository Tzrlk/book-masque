# Magic

## Low Magic
A natural and all pervasive form of magic that anyone can perform given an understanding of the ingredients and rituals required to perform it. Focused heavily on circles, each ritual requires that particular circles be drawn and particular ingredients placed at particular points within them.

## Alchemy
An analytical and refined version of Low Magic that does not require the level of ceremony or attention that it's predecessor needs to operate. By combining certain natural reagents in certain conditions and refinements, stable and predictable effects can be produced. Primarily concerned with altering and enhancing matter and energy, sometimes it also strays into spiritual and biological areas as well. Only practised by the Imperium of Man.

## Blood Magic
Blood magic is the legacy left over from the former gods of the Blood War. Each form of Blood Magic uses the dormant Heritage present within each Imperial to tap into the vast power that those gods once wielded. While far more restricted than the abilities that Vestiges are able to utilise, it is essentially the same power. Only available to the Imperium of Man.

## Death Magic
This form of Blood Magic is powered by the separation of a soul from its body. Really only useful for combat, but ritual Human sacrifice can be used to make the magic useful in other circumstances.

## Rune Magic
Concerned with relationships between concepts and ideas, Rune magic requires a set of specially prepared tokens, imbued with the essence of particular ideas. By combining these runes together between ones fingers in different ways, various effects are able to be invoked. (( Runes need charging; each has a Focus ?))

## Aspect Magic
This is the power that each and every Vestige has access to by the nature of their connection to the Masked God. By channelling their godly aspects, they can perform all manner of glamours and evocations. The only thing required to invoke any of these abilities is the expenditure of focus. Only available to the Vestiges of Gods.

## High Magic
This kind of magic comes from the graces of the Masked God. It utilises his two aspects, Creation and Destruction. Creation magic involves forming fragile tokens that when crushed, release the magic stored within. Destruction magic involves imbuing talismans with power derived from ritual sacrifices (usually with fire). Only practised by the Vestiges of Gods.
