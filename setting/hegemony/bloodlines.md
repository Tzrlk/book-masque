# Bloodlines

Each of the provinces in the imperium have long since become things of history and legend. Now there are only administritive districts.

At character creation, a player must choose the province of their Ancestry, but no tangible information is given on what that actually means. During the great crusade, Hegemon Annitus decreed divisiveness to be against the better interests of society, and began a practice of swapping children from one district to another, to avoid anyone growing up with a grudge against any other province. He also made sure that provincial culture and history were mixed with others as well, so it wouldn't even be possible to identify ones own lineage.

When the old gods were defeated by the first special project teams, their essence was so tied to their vassals, that they became a part of their people. Unbeknownst to them, each member of one of these provincial bloodlines has a measure of their former gods power, and can use it to cast spells of the type favoured by that god.

Arranged marriages are the norm in Imperium society, and children are expected to settle down in a district far away from their origin. These are both rules constructed by the Ministry Directors to dilute and weaken the bloodlines. Every time two of the same bloodline breed, the bloodline strengthens. If two different bloodlines breed, there are three possible outcomes:

1. The strength of both bloodlines is equal. The baby is stillborn as the war between the two gods kills the host. This is used as fodder to illustrate the foolishness and danger of rampant fornication.
2. One side is clearly stronger than the other. In this case, one side is eradicated, and the other weakened. An ideal situation for the Imperium, and the goal of the Ministries to ensure.
3. A reasonably rare occurrence is when one of the two bloodlines is only slightly better than the other. In this case, the child barely survives, and is sickly and weak for the rest of their lives, as the gods wear themselves down against each other, but neither gaining the upper hand. In this case, the child has access to both kinds of magic.
